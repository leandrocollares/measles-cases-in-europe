# Measles cases in Europe

The visualization comprises a horizontal bar chart 
implemented with React and D3. React renders the visualization 
components, whereas D3 handles data and axis calculations. Thanks to React Hooks, only functional
components were employed. 

Hovering over a bar causes a tooltip containing additional information to be displayed. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
